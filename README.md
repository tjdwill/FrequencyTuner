# Frequency Tuner
This is a command-line Python application that allows users to convert their music to selected frequencies (ex. 432Hz, 639Hz).

## Features

- Multiple file type support (MP3, Opus, FLAC)
- Supported frequencies: 432Hz, 639Hz
- Extensible: Adding new file types or frequencies is relatively simple.

## Requirements

- Python (developed on 3.12, but features used are all compatible down to 3.6, I believe)
  - ffmpy: Module used in this program
- FFmpeg (install ffmpeg-full to ensure all codecs are available)

Ensure ffmpeg and Python are added to your environment path.

## Example
The following is an example of the commands generated by the program (this uses the `--dryrun` option)
